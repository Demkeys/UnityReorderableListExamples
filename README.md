# UnityReorderableListExamples
Two very simple barebones examples of how to use Reorderable Lists in Editor scripts. Both examples show how to setup and user ReorderableList with custom GUI in Editor scripts using the various callbacks provided.
* [ReorderableListExample01.cs](https://github.com/Demkeys/UnityReorderableListExamples/blob/master/ReorderableListExample01.cs) allows you to add items at the end of the list.
* [ReorderableListExample02.cs](https://github.com/Demkeys/UnityReorderableListExamples/blob/master/ReorderableListExample02.cs) allows you to add items after the currently selected item, and also add items at the end of the list.
